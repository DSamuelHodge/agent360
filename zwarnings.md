## Test Development Plan

1. Phase 1: Core Functionality (In Progress)
   - Basic workflow execution and state management
   - Retry policy handling (failing)
   - Basic integration manager functionality
   - Database connection resilience
   - User authentication and authorization

2. Phase 2: Error Handling
   - Workflow error recovery
   - Integration failure handling
   - Database failover scenarios
   - Authentication edge cases

3. Phase 3: Integration Testing
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Multi-integration scenarios
   - Database performance tests
   - Security testing

## Current Warnings and Issues

### Test Failures
1. `test_workflow_retry_policy` in `test_agent_workflow.py`:
   - Issue: Test fails when simulating retry behavior
   - Error: "Temporary error" exception not being caught by retry mechanism
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Next Steps: 
     - Review retry policy implementation
     - Verify mock setup for Temporal activities
     - Consider adjusting retry intervals for testing

### Deprecation Warnings
1. Cassandra Driver Warning:
   ```
   DeprecationWarning: The asyncore module is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.12
   ```
   - Action: Plan migration to asyncio-based driver
   - Priority: HIGH (Python 3.12 compatibility)

2. Pydantic Warning:
   ```
   PydanticDeprecatedSince20: Support for class-based config is deprecated
   ```
   - Action: Migrate to ConfigDict
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Location: Multiple files using Pydantic models

3. Pytest Asyncio Warning:
   ```
   DeprecationWarning: The event_loop fixture has been redefined
   ```
   - Action: Update test configuration to use proper asyncio scope
   - Location: `tests/conftest.py:26`
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Fix: Use scope argument in asyncio mark instead of redefining fixture

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions (HIGH Priority)
   - Fix failing retry policy test in `test_agent_workflow.py`
   - Update Cassandra driver before Python 3.12 upgrade
   - Review and update test event loop configuration

2. Short Term (MEDIUM Priority)
   - Migrate Pydantic models to use ConfigDict
   - Create test fixtures for workflows and integration manager
   - Implement mock services for external dependencies

3. Long Term (LOW Priority)
   - Add comprehensive test cases for database operations
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with coverage reporting
   - Complete integration test suite
