# Agent360 Reasoning Engine Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Agent360 Reasoning Engine is a sophisticated component that enables intelligent decision-making and cognitive processing through a combination of LLM-based inference, memory management, and orchestrated workflow patterns. This document provides a detailed technical explanation of its architecture and operation.

## Core Components

### 1. Reasoning Engine (`ReasoningEngine`)
The central component that coordinates reasoning operations and memory management.

#### Key Features:
- **Direct Reasoning**: Processes prompts with context-aware LLM inference
- **Reflection Capability**: Meta-cognitive processing of past decisions
- **Memory Integration**: Seamless access to historical context
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and tracing

#### Implementation Details:
```python
class ReasoningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model_client: ModelClient, memory_client: MemoryClient):
        self.model = model_client
        self.memory = memory_client

    async def reason(self, agent_id: UUID, context: Dict[str, Any], prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Retrieves relevant memories
        # Combines context with memories
        # Generates response through LLM
        # Stores reasoning step
```

### 2. Workflow Patterns

#### 2.1 Chain of Thought Pattern
Implements step-by-step reasoning with reflection.

**Process Flow**:
1. Initial reasoning step
2. Reflection on reasoning
3. Final response compilation

```python
class ChainOfThought(WorkflowPattern):
    async def execute(self, context: AgentContext, prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Initial reasoning
        # Reflection
        # Response compilation
```

#### 2.2 Reflective Execution Pattern
Focuses on meta-cognitive processing and self-improvement.

#### 2.3 Parallel Reasoning Pattern
Enables concurrent execution of multiple reasoning approaches.

**Features**:
- Parallel approach execution
- Result combination strategies
- Error handling per approach

### 3. Memory Management

#### Memory Structure:
```python
class Memory:
    def __init__(self, memory_id: str, agent_id: UUID, memory_type: str, content: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.id = memory_id
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.type = memory_type
        self.content = content
```

- Memory storage
- Context retrieval
- Reflection processing

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Adding New Patterns
```python
class NewPattern(WorkflowPattern):
    async def execute(self, context: AgentContext, prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Pattern implementation
```

### 2. Memory Integration
```python
async def store_memory(self, agent_id: UUID, memory_type: str, content: Dict[str, Any]):
    # Memory storage implementation
```

### 3. Pattern Factory Usage
```python
patterns = WorkflowPatterns(reasoning_engine, event_store)
chain_of_thought = patterns.chain_of_thought()
```
